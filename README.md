# LightServer Code and Binaries

LightServer is a Wifi enabled embedded device which controls RGB Intelligent lighting in various ways. 
You can control the lights via iOS Apps or via a webpages that are on the device.

The quickest way to understand what LightServer does, is to view the demos on 
Vimeo - https://vimeo.com/album/3015956 

### How Can LightServer Be Used?

It can be used in various lighting and entertainment situations, including parties, festive events,
mood lighting, out door lights and many many ways I have not thought of. I look forward to seeing how 
you use LightServer.

### Detailed Installation Instructions

Detailed instruction on how to build a LightServer for both non-programmers and programmers can 
be found on the following Github Wiki - 

There are additional resources located in the LightServer Resources Repository here - 

### Who Is Welcome To Use This Code?

Anyone! You will likely find this code or binaries very useful if you are one of the following:-

* A RGB Lighting Hobbyist or Enthusist (No Programming Skills Required, just a little soldering 
and software installations).
* A Maker or Electronics Enthusiast (Design a custom board, share with the community)
* An Open Source Programmer (Join the community efforts and add your own features)
* A Professional who develops for the Texas Instruments Tiva C and the CC3100/CC3200 MCUs 
(There is a lot of helpful code to perform all sorts of tasks).
* A Manufacturer of Electronic Lighting Devices (You are free to use this code to develop a 
commercial product based on Texas Instruments MCUs, contact me for more information or 
assistance). If you feel generous, I am always open to receiving some public thanks and
the end product if possible. If not possible, it still would be great to know where my code has 
ended up.

### Who Cannot Use This Code?

* The code has been developed for a specific platform (TI ARM Cortex M4 MCUs) using specific IDE (Code 
Composure Studio) and RTOS (TI-RTOS). So most of it will only function when you use this technology.
* Though I cannot anyone using code that has been made available on the Internet in what ever way they see fit. 
I do ask that is you are looking to develop a product using this code, that you at least take a good look at 
Texas Instruments MCUs. No, I am not a TI employee, but I am a TI MVP and as such I am pretty passionate about
the latest Wifi IoT MCUs from TI.

### No Developer Experience Required

Not a problem, you can access the pre-built binaries and follow the detailed steps. You will 
have your very own LightServer being controlled by iOS Apps in no time. 

### What Lights Are Required

One of the best things about LightServer is that it works with the very popular and common 
WS8212b Chip Set lights. These are the 5volt ones that can be found everywhere. I have 
tested extensively with NeoPixels.

### What Technology Is Being Used

This application is developed in C and is using Texas Instruments Tiva C MCU and the CC3100 Wifi Chip. 

I really hope you get something from LightServer or its code.
